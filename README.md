# FIT2102 Assignment 1

All of your changes, code, and game files should be in the src folder.

## Development

There are two ways to run the code:

1. Build the code and then open the web page

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run build`
- Open the html file dist/index.html (NOT src/index.html)

2. Use the development server

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`, this will automatically open a web page at localhost:4000
- Open localhost:4000 in your browser if it didn't already

The development server will have some additional features that help with the
development process, but are not essential.



# Feedback for assignment
##Report: 93 ##FP style: 77 ##Code Quality: 80 ##Observable usage: 85 ##Features: 80 ##Final mark: 83/100 
##Feedback: Good justification in your report. There could be more discussion as to why having pure code is useful.
Good sectioning of code, and using intermediate variables to calculate logic, to reduce complexity of later expressions. Code is straightforward. Comments don't improve understandability of the code, more detail is required of how the functions should be used. Some hardcoded magic numbers, could save these as named constants. Occasional long lines. Overall understandable code.
Good use of higher order functions. Functions used are pure. Nice breakdown of functions into smaller parts (like in tick), with more general types. Same type system as asteroids.
Same overall obversable structure as asteroids, with additional functionality of spawning objects.
Good game, with nice features. It's fun to play but very challenging. Meets the requirements for a full game. Good work!
